## Introduction
We are now starting our mobile development journey!

We are kicking off with this project, where you will get hands on with Dart, a modern programming language developed by Google. Dart is fast, easy to learn, and perfect for building apps for mobile, web, and backend. You’ll explore its clean syntax, strong typing, and learn how it powers Flutter to create smooth, high-performance applications.

In this project, we will begin with the fundamentals, printing output, working with different data types, and exploring basic operations laying the foundation for more advanced Dart programming in the future.
